## Alexa-NumberFacts

### What it does
This app provides a speech interface for the Numbers API http://numbersapi.com/ 
The program enables the following requests:
 - Fact about a specific number
 - Fact about a specific date
 - Random fact about a year, date, math or generic trivia.

### Tools Used
The program is written in Python and hosted on AWS lambda. I used some of the following modules to retrieve the codes:
* BeautifulSoup - Used to parse html content in this project
* urllib.request to open urls
